## 🧠 Overview  

**VisualARQ** is an architectural extension for **Rhino** that adds structured, parametric building components to a highly flexible 3D modeling platform. It allows designers to work with intelligent architectural elements while maintaining Rhino’s open-ended geometry capabilities.

Building components such as walls, openings, slabs, and stairs remain editable and interconnected, making design revisions fast and predictable. Project changes automatically propagate through drawings and views, reducing rework and improving consistency.

VisualARQ supports a fluid design process that bridges conceptual modeling and technical documentation.
